/* Sample program which uses the registration key system. This program's
 * security code is 24805 - I would suggest that you change this value
 * use in any programs you have written. When compiled, this program must
 * be linked with the BP?.LIB file. For more information on compiling
 * programs using the registration key system, please see the accompanying
 * documentation, in the file REGKEY.DOC. This program reads the
 * registration information from the file REGISTER.KEY. The program expects
 * to find the registered user's name on the first line of this file, and
 * the user's registration key on the second line of this file.
